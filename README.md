# gpt-red-carpet-reviewer

A web application that can review any of the custom GPT models that are on the GPT store platform, in real-time. My incorporating the GitHub repository  'gptstore-data-backup.' It the repo gets automatically updated everyday for any changes, updates, and/or new GPT models that is on the Officail platform and archives all GPTs in a accessible archive directory.
As well as an additional feature that is:
A side-by-side GPT Comparison feature for the users to make more accurate decisions on the moddel they choose.

I want the theme to be as if it is an Award Cerimony like the Grammy's, Emmy's, and any other Red Carpet event. with interactive/  responsive components thatfit and relate to the theme of the web app.
